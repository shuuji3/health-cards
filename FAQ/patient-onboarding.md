# はじめに

学校への登校、職場への出勤、旅行の予約などをするとき、COVID-19の検査やワクチン接種に関する情報を提供することを求められることがあります。SMART Health Cardsを使用すると、デジタルまたは紙に複製された標準化されたあなたの情報を保管し、あなたか共有することを選んだ時にその情報を共有できます。ほとんどの紙のカードとは違い、SMART Health Cardは「検証可能」です。カードを提供した組織のデジタル署名が含まれているため、情報が正しいことを確認することができるようになっています。

## SMART Health Cardとは何ですか？

SMART Health Cardには、次のようなあなたに関する情報が含まれています。
* あなたの法的な名前と誕生日
* あなたの医療情報（検査の結果やワクチン接種の記録など）
  * 検査の結果には、検査の実施時間、検査キットの製造会社、検査の陽性または陰性の結果などの情報が含まれます。
  * ワクチン接種記録には、ワクチンの種類、ワクチン接種の場所と時間が含まれています。

## SMART Health Cardはどこで入手できますか？

Any organization that has your information might be able to issue you a SMART Health Card. That could be the lab, clinic, pharmacy, or site where you got your COVID-19 vaccine or lab test, even after you received your immunization. The place that gives you the card “signs” it digitally, which helps ensure the information is correct. Additionally, if you manage the healthcare of your child or another person, you may also access and download their SMART Health Cards.

## SMART Health Cardの入手や使用は有料ですか？

There should be no fee to get a SMART Health Card. If you decide to share the information in your SMART Health Card with somebody, there should be no fee for you or them.

## SMART Health Cardsはどのように私のプライバシーを守ってくれますか？

You are in control of sharing, or not sharing, your SMART Health Card. If you choose, you can print your SMART Health Card on paper, or save it in an app on your phone. If you have a printed SMART Health Card, you decide when to let someone scan it. If you have a SMART Health Card on your phone, you decide when to share.

SMART Health Cards contain only your name, date of birth, and information about your COVID-19 immunization or lab results. They do not contain your phone number, address, a government-issued identifier, or any other information about your health.

Your information is stored directly within a SMART Health Card barcode ("QR Code") or a SMART Health Card file that you control. It is not stored in any computer systems outside of the organization that gave you the SMART Health Card.

## SMART Health Cardはどのように使えますか？

You might receive a SMART Health Card printed on a piece of paper or electronically from your doctor's office. This SMART Health Card contains information about you; the card is yours, and you can share it when you choose.

On paper, your SMART Health Card contains your information, including a 2D barcode; it will look something like this:

You might also have access to your SMART Health Card through a website or an app on your phone. You can choose to print these barcodes yourself or let someone scan the barcode right from your personal device.

### バーコードとしてのSMART Health Cardsの共有

A SMART Health Card usually includes just one barcode, but might include two barcodes or more. By allowing someone to scan these barcodes from your paper print-out or from your phone's screen, you are sharing the information in your SMART Health Card.

### アプリ間でのSMART Health Cardsの共有

You might be able to share your SMART Health Card from one app on your phone to another. When you share a SMART Health Card with an app on your phone, you are sharing the information in your SMART Health Card.

### SMART Health Cardsの破棄

You can destroy a paper-based SMART Health Card or delete an electronic SMART Health Card at any time. Keep in mind that anyone you have shared this information with may still have a copy.
